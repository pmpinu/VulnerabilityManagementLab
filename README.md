<h1>Vulnerability Management Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I'm going to be installing <i>Kali Linux</i> and <i>Rapid 7's Metasploitable 2</i> in their own respective virtual machines. Then, using <i>Tenable's Nessus Essentials</i>, I will be performing discovery and vulnerability scanning, scanning enrichment through automation and prioritization, reviewing/analyzing results, and lastly, producing a report. <br><br><br><br>


<p align="center">
I'm going to be using the Kali Linux virtual machine as a host for Nessus Essentials. After firing up Kali, I installed Nessus Essentials (https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials): <br/>

Starting the service and confirming service process is up and running via the commands below:<br/>
"<i>sudo service nessusd start</i>" and "<i>sudo service nessusd status</i>":

<br />
<br />

In the next steps, I am accessing the Nessus service through the browser interface via <i>https://kali:8834/</i> and then allowing the compilation of plugins(this can take a while):<br/>

<br />
<br />

While Nessus plugins compile on my Kali machine, I am going to download (https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/) and install our vulnerable machine, Metasploitable 2:<br/>

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">
In the next steps, I am checking the IPs of both machines to confirm they are on the same network and testing connectivity between them in both directions by using PING:<br/>

<br />
<br />

In this step, I'm performing a Discovery Scan through the Nessus interface. Normally, you'd want to specify a IP range, but since I only have one target in this case---Metasploitable 2 VM, I will limit my IP scope to that target's specific IP:<br/>

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">
Once the scan is created, I launch the scan and the specified host is discovered and displayed. This concludes the "Host Discovery" step:<br/>

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">
Now that I've found a target system through host discovery, my next step is to scan the target for vulnerabilities. I'm going to perform one scan with credentials and another without credentials: <br/>
