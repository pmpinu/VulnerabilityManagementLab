<h1>Vulnerability Management Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I'm going to be installing <i>Kali Linux</i> and <i>Rapid 7's Metasploitable 2</i> in their own respective virtual machines. Then, using <i>Tenable's Nessus Essentials</i>, I will be performing discovery and vulnerability scanning, scanning enrichment through automation and prioritization, reviewing/analyzing results, and lastly, producing a report. <br><br><br><br>


<p align="center">
I'm going to be using the Kali Linux virtual machine as a host for Nessus Essentials. After firing up Kali, I installed Nessus Essentials (https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials): <br/>

Starting the service and confirming service process is up and running via the commands below:<br/>
"<i>sudo service nessusd start</i>" and "<i>sudo service nessusd status</i>":

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">
In the next steps, I am accessing the Nessus service through the browser interface via <i>https://kali:8834/</i> and then allowing the compilation of plugins(this can take a while):<br/>

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">
While Nessus plugins compile on my Kali machine, I am going to download (https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/) and install our vulnerable machine, Metasploitable 2:<br/>

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">
In the next steps, I am checking the IPs of both machines to confirm they are on the same network and testing connectivity between them in both directions by using PING:<br/>

<br />

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">
In this step, I'm performing a Discovery Scan through the Nessus interface. Normally, you'd want to specify a IP range, but since I only have one target in this case---Metasploitable 2 VM, I will limit my IP scope to that target's specific IP:<br/>

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">
Once the scan is created, I launch the scan and the specified host is discovered and displayed. This concludes the "Host Discovery" step:<br/>

<br />
<br />

<p align="center">
Now that I've found a target system through host discovery, my next step is to scan the target for vulnerabilities. I'm going to perform one scan with credentials and another without credentials: <br/>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
For the credential scan, I'm going to use the login and password for the target Metasploitable 2 machine:<br/>

<br />

<br />
<p align="center">
Because credential scans login to the target system and execute commands directly, they generally find more vulnerabilities:<br/>

<br />
<p align="center">
Now that I've completed the vulnerability scans, I have plenty of data to work with. For demonstration purposes, I've only scanned one target but in large enterprise environments, there can be thousands of assets to scan. In the next steps, I present some Scanning Enrichment configurations (automation, scheduling, and prioritization) in order to address this scalabiity issue:<br/>

<br />
<p align="center">
To further narrow down the 32 critical vulnerabilities found in the credential scan, I'm applying additional filters by specifying readily available exploits, critical severity, and remote access to the kernel interface:<br/>

<br />
<p align="center">
While the highest risk vulnerability out of the results can be subjective, I think that gaining control of the interface that directly communicates with the kernel should be addressed before the rest:<br/>
